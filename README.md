GraphMaster
===========

Side project to perform various CS graphing algorithms.  Currently you can create a directed graph, move the nodes around, and change the weight of the edges.

The goal is to run:

Shortest Path
- Dijkstra's
- Bellman-Ford

Minimum Spanning Tree
- Prim's
- Kruskals

Search
- Depth-First
- Breadh-First

Currently there is an unvalidated implementation of Dijkstras.

Flipped up submenu lying under the graph view.  A fun gimmicky thing I was trying out.
