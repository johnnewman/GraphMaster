GraphMaster
===========

Side project to make an app to perform various CS graphing algorithms.  Currently you can create a directed graph, move the nodes around, and change the weight of the edges.

The goal was to initially be able to run:

Shortest Path
-Dijkstra's
-Bellman-Ford

Minnimum Spanning Tree
-Prim's
-Kruskals

Search
-Depth-First
-Breadh-First

Currently there is an implementation of Dijkstras, but I haven't validated it.  Also, the app has not been updated to iOS 7.  Some minor changes need to occur before it looks equivalent to the 6.1 version.
